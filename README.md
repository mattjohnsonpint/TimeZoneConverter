## TimeZoneConverter.Posix  [![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/TimeZoneConverter.Posix.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TimeZoneConverter.Posix/)

--------------------------------

- TimeZoneConverter is a lightweight library to convert quickly between IANA, Windows, and Rails time zone names.
- TimeZoneConverter.Posix adds support for generating POSIX time zone strings, which are useful in certain scenarios such as IoT.

## TimeZoneConverter Installation

```powershell
PM> Install-Package TimeZoneConverter
```

This library should be compatible with .NET Standard 1.1 and greater, as well as .NET Framework 3.5 and greater.
See the [.NET Standard Platform Support Matrix][1] for further details about .NET Standard,
and please raise an issue if you encounter any compatibility errors.

#### Note on newer .NET Versions

.NET 6 will have built-in support for IANA and Windows time zones in a cross-platform manner, removing the need for the TimeZoneConverter library.
If you are planning to use .NET 6 (or higher), you should also plan to *not* use the TimeZoneConverter library.

This work is being tracked in these two issues:

- https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/49412 - Implicit conversion when calling `TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById` (completed)
- https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/49407 - Explicit conversion via new APIs

#### Note on OS Data Dependencies

Some functions, such as `TZConvert.GetTimeZoneInfo` rely on the underlying `TimeZoneInfo` object having access to
time zone data of the operating system.  On Windows, this data comes from the registry and is maintained via Windows Updates.

On OSX and Linux, this data comes from a distribution of the [IANA time zone database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones),  usually via the `tzdata` package.  If your environment does not have the `tzdata` package installed, you will need to install it for `TZConvert.GetTimeZoneInfo` to work correctly.

For example, the Alpine Linux Docker images for .NET Core no longer ship with `tzdata`.  See [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1366](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1366) for instructions on how to add it to your Docker images.

## TimeZoneConverter.Posix Installation

```powershell
PM> Install-Package TimeZoneConverter.Posix
```

This library should be compatible with .NET Standard 1.3 and greater, as well as .NET Framework 4.5 and greater.
See the [.NET Standard Platform Support Matrix][1] for further details about .NET Standard,
and please raise an issue if you encounter any compatibility errors.

Note that `TimeZoneConverter.Posix` takes a dependency on both `TimeZoneConverter` and [Noda Time][2].

## Notes

This library uses a combination of data sources to achieve its goals:

- The [Unicode CLDR][3] project
- The [IANA time zone][4] data
- Microsoft Windows [time zone updates][5]
- The `MAPPING` data from `ActiveSupport::TimeZone` in [the Rails source code][6].
- The author's best-informed knowledge and opinions

Usually, the latter is reserved for edge cases, and for newly-introduced zones that may
or may not have been published to official sources yet.

**Important:** Since this data can change whenever new time zones are introduced from any of these sources,
it is recommended that you always use the most current revision, and check for updates regularly.

Additionally, this library does not attempt to determine if the time zone IDs provided are actually present on the computer where the code is running.  It is assumed that the computer is kept current with time zone updates.

For example, if one attempts to convert `Africa/Khartoum` to a Windows time zone ID, they will get `Sudan Standard Time`.  If it is then used on a Windows computer that does not yet have [`KB4051956`][7] installed (which created this time zone), they will likely get a `TimeZoneNotFoundException`.

## Example Usage

Convert an IANA time zone name to the best fitting Windows time zone ID.

```csharp
string tz = TZConvert.IanaToWindows("America/New_York");
// Result:  "Eastern Standard Time"
```

Convert a Windows time zone name to the best fitting IANA time zone name.

```csharp
string tz = TZConvert.WindowsToIana("Eastern Standard Time");
// result:  "America/New_York"
```

Convert a Windows time zone name to the best fitting IANA time zone name, with regard to a specific country.

```csharp
string tz = TZConvert.WindowsToIana("Eastern Standard Time", "CA");
// result:  "America/Toronto"
```

Get a `TimeZoneInfo` object from .NET Core, regardless of what OS you are running on:  
*Helps with .NET Runtime issue [#18644][8]*  
***This function is only available for .NET Standard 1.3+ or full .NET Framework targets***

```csharp
// Either of these will work on any platform:
TimeZoneInfo tzi = TZConvert.GetTimeZoneInfo("Eastern Standard Time");
TimeZoneInfo tzi = TZConvert.GetTimeZoneInfo("America/New_York");
```

Convert a Rails time zone name to the best fitting IANA time zone name.

```csharp
string tz = TZConvert.RailsToIana("Mexico City");
// result:  "America/Mexico_City"
```

Convert a Rails time zone name to the best fitting Windows time zone ID.

```csharp
string tz = TZConvert.RailsToWindows("Mexico City");
// result:  "Central Standard Time (Mexico)"
```

Convert an IANA time zone name to one or more Rails time zone names.

```csharp
IList<string> tz = TZConvert.IanaToRails("America/Mexico_City");
// Result:  { "Guadalajara", "Mexico City" }
```

Convert a Windows time zone ID to one or more Rails time zone names.

```csharp
IList<string> tz = TZConvert.WindowsToRails("Central Standard Time (Mexico)");
// Result:  { "Guadalajara", "Mexico City" }
```

Generate a POSIX time zone string from a Windows time zone ID.

*Requires `TimeZoneConverter.Posix`*

```csharp
string posix = PosixTimeZone.FromWindowsTimeZoneId("Eastern Standard Time");
// Result: "EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0"
```

Generate a POSIX time zone string from an IANA time zone name.

*Requires `TimeZoneConverter.Posix`*

```csharp
string posix = PosixTimeZone.FromIanaTimeZoneName("Australia/Sydney");
// Result: "AEST-10AEDT,M10.1.0,M4.1.0/3"
```

Generate a POSIX time zone string from a `TimeZoneInfo` object.

*Requires `TimeZoneConverter.Posix`*

```csharp
string posix = PosixTimeZone.FromTimeZoneInfo(TimeZoneInfo.Local);
```
